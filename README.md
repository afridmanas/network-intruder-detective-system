# network-intruder-detective-system
Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are set up at a planned point within the network to examine traffic from all devices on the network. It performs an observation of passing traffic on the entire subnet and matches the traffic that is passed on the subnets to the collection of known attacks.

# Objectives and Specifications

The purpose of this project is to develop, construct, and test a reliable and secure intrusion detection system (IDS) that can be used to safeguard any type of network. It can also quickly notify the administration of the intrusion or any questionable behavior It collects all of the different protocols and traffic information and sends it straight to the network administrator, who then determines what to do with the traffic, whether to allow it to continue or to stop it.
